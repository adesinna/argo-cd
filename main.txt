In a push model, you have ton grant the ci tool, kubeconfig file and access to be able to access the cluster, also
the cicd has to have kubectl and helm in other to deploy and this cloud be a security concern.

This is where argocd comes in, this is how argocd works.

The ci tools will manage

Build -- Test -- Docker Build -- Push to Registry -- Update the kubernetes image tag

There is no access to the cluster by the ci tool, argocd will pull the image from the repo, argocd agent keeps
watching the repo for any change. It keeps tracking the changes and reconcile the changes to update it into the cluster.

You will be the state visibility of the cluster, health status , current status.  It is also easy to rollback

Concepts in argocd:
Application:
    This consist of two things source of manifest(git) and the destination cluster.

Projects:
    This is a logical grouping of your applications, this is useful when argocd is used by multiple teams.

Desired State vs Actual State:
    Desired is what is on your github and the actual state is what is running on your cluster.


Sync:
    This is the process of making the actual state to be what is desired
